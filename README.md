# Database_Project

For this project I created a database to manage boats in a race. 

The users will primarily be boat captains, who will input their boat’s data to register for the race of their
choosing. However, it can also be used by the organizers, who will need to input the times for
the results, or third parties who may be interested in current or past results.
The boats’ information will be entered into the registration, and will also appear in the
results. The registration applies to the races, which are tied to their location and produce the
results.

The database will also record data such as the number and placing of entrants, as well
as basic information about each race (name, date, time, start and finish locations, etc.).
The database will be able to answer queries including the following:
1. Can the boat register for a specific race?
2. What is a list of all boats that can register for a specific race?
3. Which races are available?
4. Where is a specific race?
5. When is a specific race?
6. How many boats are registered for a specific race?
7. What is a list of all winners of past iterations of a specific race?
8. Did a specific boat finish a specific race within the time limit?
9. Did a specific boat win a specific race?
10. What time will a specific boat start a specific race, given that boat’s start time?
